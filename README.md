# ⚽ Real Madrid Website Clone

Welcome to the **Real Madrid Clone** project! If you’re as passionate about Real Madrid as you are about coding, you’re in the right place! This fan-made web application replicates the core design and functionality of the official Real Madrid website, allowing us to dive into real-world web development by emulating a site loved by millions.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

This project is more than just a static replica—it’s a fully responsive, interactive, and scalable clone that captures the Real Madrid experience, including:

- 🎥 **Media Gallery** – Browse through an elegant showcase of photos and videos.
- 👥 **Player Profiles** – Discover the roster, stats, and personal details of Real Madrid players.
- 📜 **Club History & Achievements** – Celebrate the club’s legendary legacy.
- 🧭 **User-Friendly Navigation** – Clean, intuitive, and mobile-friendly interface inspired by the official site.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

The Real Madrid Clone is built using a classic stack of front-end and back-end technologies for flexibility and scalability:

- **HTML5 & CSS3** for structure and styling
- **Bootstrap CSS** for a responsive and sleek design
- **JavaScript** for dynamic content and interactivity
- **PHP** for server-side logic and backend functionality
- **MySQL** for managing and storing data such as player profiles, match schedules, and statistics

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide
